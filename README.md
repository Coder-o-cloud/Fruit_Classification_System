# 🍎 Fruit Classification System

## 📌 Overview

The Fruit Classification System is a Python-based machine learning project that classifies fruits using image recognition. It leverages deep learning techniques to detect fruit types by analyzing features like shape, color, and texture. This system helps automate fruit sorting and recognition tasks in agriculture and retail.

## 🚀 Features

* Classifies multiple fruit types from images
* Uses Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV
* Trains on image datasets for accurate predictions
* Easy-to-use interface for testing fruit images
* Scalable for agricultural and retail applications

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
* **Dataset:** Fruit image dataset (custom or public)
